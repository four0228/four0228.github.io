				<li>What are the three components of Web?<br>HTML, CSS, and Java Script.
				</li>
				<li>Define version control and give one example.<br>Version Control is the tracking and managing of changes to code. GitHub is a version control software, tracking the changes written in Sublime Text and asking the user to review and choose to publish.</li>
				<li>What tag is used to create the title of a web page? Give an example.<br> the head and title tag are used to create a title of a web page. The title tag is the child of the head tag. For an example, if I wanted the tab of my web page to be read as "BookFace" I would put "BookFace" in a title tag.</li>
				<li>What tag is used to create a paragraph in html? Give an example.<br>The P tag, or Paragraph tag, is used to create a paragraph in HTML.</li>
				<p>This is an example of the P tag in use in HTML.</p>
				<li>Identify the odd one from these tags: span, p, a, i  and state the reason?<br>I would say the p tag is the odd one out as span, a, and i can all be contained in a p tag, but not necesarily the other way around. Not to mention span and i influence the apearance of a tag and the a impacts how a user iteracts with a line of code, but the line of code starts and ends with a p tag.</li>
